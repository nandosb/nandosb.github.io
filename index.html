      <p>Engineering Manager for "Turbo" project (10 min delivery for groceries).</p>
      <p>Rappi bought 2 companies to kick off this project in Mexico and Brazil. It was my role to manage engineers from the 2 existing companies, plus some other engineers from Rappi. The challenge was to unify the codebases and have a single system to manage the operation in Latam while we also customized the system for our particular needs. I helped the team to transition inventory, billing, and other configuration from the existing companies to Rappi in order to kick-off our very own operations. Another interesting piece was the integration with the Rappi app, which is our main sales channel.</p>
      <p>In parallel, I've been constantly involved in hiring and growing the team by adding more backend, frontend, data scientist, and mobile engineers</p>
      <p>By the time I left, I was responsible for 3 teams (Tech Leads, BE engs, FE engs, Mobile engs, QA engs)</p>

      <ul>
        <li>System design & architecture</li>
        <li>Hiring: Backend engineers, Frontend engineers, Data analyst</li>

      <h2>2009 – Systems engineering @ UTN.FRM</h2>
      <p>An interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles. At its core, systems engineering utilizes systems thinking principles to organize this body of knowledge. Issues, such as: requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission, all become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial, mechanical, manufacturing, control, software and electrical engineering, cybernetics, organizational studies and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.</p>
