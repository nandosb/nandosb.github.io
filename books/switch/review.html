      <article>
      <p>The book introduces a simple framework to drive changes at different level, from personal to professional. It describes why change might be hard for people, why people often “resist” changing and reveals a set of instruments that anyone can use to impulse a change successfully.</p>

      <p>The framework describes 3 main elements that you have to take into account when you’re looking for a change:</br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Rider</strong>: it’s a metaphor for the rational part of people. That part that digests stats and tries to “objectively” optimize the result among different choices.</li>
          <li><strong>The Elephant</strong>: it’s a metaphor for all the emotions and instincts behind people’s decisions. The elephant is where our behaviors are represented and our habits are built.</li>
          <li><strong>The Path</strong>: it represents the context, the situation where you or the people involved in a process of change are living. It’s the ecosystem around us that affects our decisions.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Having clear the 3 main elements of a change, then the book provides different ways to tweak them.</p>

      <h3>How to influence the rider</h3>

      <p>What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. You have to give crystal clear direction if you want people to change. The following the way the book recommends to do so.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Find the bright spot</strong>: if you want to capture the attention of the rider, show her the a bright spot. Find those cases that are doing well in the middle of a messy situation. Find those little stories of success and understand why they can “win”, what they are doing different to overcome the situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Script the critical moves</strong>: provide some key guidelines that will drive the change. Change begins at the level of individual decisions and behaviors, but that’s a hard place to start because that’s where the friction is. Inertia and decision paralysis will conspire to keep people doing things in the old way. You have to provide a set of rules for people to follow. Only experience will help you to define the balance between something to specific and something too vague that people don’t know how to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Point to the destination</strong>: Describe what the destination point looks like. This will provide the clarity that people need to fight against the natural resistance to change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to influence the elephant</h3>

      <p>What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. Even when it’s clear for the rider what direction to take, it can’t keep that direction for so long if the emotional side is not helping. Emotions have to cooperate if you want the change to preveal for a long time.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Find the feeling</strong>: Find those feelings and histories that are relevant for the people you’re dealing with. Knowing something is not enough to cause change. You have to be able to connect with people’s values and beliefs, with something that matters to people and can inspire them.</li>
        <li><strong>Shrink the change</strong>: The key for this point is to be aware that the elephant loves immediate gratification. Hope is the elephant fuel and reaching milestones refuel the elephant making it more likely to pursue the next milestone. Break down the change or use some tricks (you’ll have to read the book to know what they are) to make a big change look smaller or give the sense that the destination is around the corner.</li>
        <li><strong>Grow your people</strong>: The elephant must believe it’s capable of making the change. Heat brothers talk about growth mindset and fixed mindset. People with growth mindset believe that their brain is a muscle that can always incorporate new abilities by practice, so they can accept more challenges despite the risk of failure. On the other hand, people with fixed mindset believe that their abilities are static or stay the same</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to shape the path</h3>

      <p>What looks like a people problem it’s often a situational problem. When the path is shaped, you make the changes more likely, regardless what happens with the rider or the elephant.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tweak the environment</strong>: change the environment to make good habits easier to perform. When the situation changes, behaviour change.</li>
        <li><strong>Build habits</strong>: When people build habits, the cost of decision is 0. Doing the right thing is now free. There are important things to keep in mind: the habit must serve and support your mission, and two, the habit must be relatively easy to embrace.</li>
        <li><strong>Rally the herd</strong>: In time of change, it’s usual that people don’t know how to behave and that can lead to problems. The elephant, the emotional thing of the people, always looks other people when it doesn’t know what to do or how to behave. Many things that people do, is because they see their peers doing it. Behaviour is contagious</li>
